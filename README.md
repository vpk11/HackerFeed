## Features

*   Displays a list of Hackernews.
*   Allows users to read complete article.
*   Allows users to favorite articles and view them later.
*   "About" screen with app information, developer details, and links to portfolio, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
*   Modern UI built with Jetpack Compose.

## Tech Stack & Libraries

*   **Language:** [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (100%)
*   **UI Toolkit:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.
*   **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) utilizing Jetpack ViewModel and StateFlow to manage UI state for Composable functions.
*   **Core Jetpack Libraries:**
    *   `androidx.activity:activity-compose` - For Compose integration in Activities.
    *   `androidx.compose.material3:material3` - Material Design 3 components.
    *   `androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling-preview` - For Composable previews in Android Studio.
    *   `androidx.compose.runtime:runtime` - Core Compose runtime.
    *   `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose` - For observing Lifecycle-aware state.
*   **Serialization:**
    *   `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json` - For parsing json response from Hackernews api.
*   **Navigation:** Intent-based navigation between Activities
*   **Build Tool:** Gradle

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

*   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Latest stable version recommended)
*   Android SDK installed (ensure you have the necessary SDK Platforms and Build Tools).
*   Kotlin plugin installed in Android Studio (usually comes bundled).
*   An Android device or Emulator (API level 24+ recommended).

### Cloning the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vpk11/HackerFeed.git
cd HackerFeed
```
### Importing into Android Studio

1.  Open Android Studio.
2.  Select **File > New > Import Project...** (or **Open an existing Android Studio project** from the welcome screen).
3.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the project (`HackerFeed` folder).
4.  Select the root `build.gradle` file or the project directory itself.
5.  Click **OK**.
6.  Android Studio will then sync the project with Gradle. This might take a few minutes, especially on the first import, as it downloads necessary dependencies.

## Building the APK

### Debug APK

A debug APK is useful for testing and development.

1.  In Android Studio, select **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**.
2.  Once the build is complete, a notification will appear in the bottom-right corner of Android Studio.
3.  Click on the **locate** link in the notification.
4.  This will open the `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/` directory, where you'll find `app-debug.apk`.
5.  You can install this APK directly onto an Android device or emulator.

Alternatively, running the app directly on a connected device or emulator from Android Studio (by clicking the "Run" button) will also build and install a debug version.

### Release APK

A release APK is a signed version of your app, ready for distribution (e.g., on the Google Play Store or other platforms).

**Important:** Before building a release APK, you need to set up signing configurations.

1.  **Generate an Upload Key and Keystore:**
    *   If you don't have one, follow the official Android documentation: [Sign your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)
2.  **Configure Signing in `build.gradle`:**
    *   Open your module-level `build.gradle` (e.g., `app/build.gradle` or `app/build.gradle.kts`).
    *   Add a `signingConfigs` block and configure your release build type to use it.
    *   **Security Note:** It's highly recommended to store your keystore passwords securely (e.g., in `keystore.properties` and add that file to `.gitignore`, or use environment variables in a CI/CD system) rather than hardcoding them in `build.gradle`. See the "Secure your keys" section in the official docs.
3.  **Build the Release APK:**
    *   In Android Studio, select **Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK...**.
    *   Choose **APK** and click **Next**.
    *   Select your keystore, enter passwords, and choose your key alias. Click **Next**.
    *   Choose the destination folder for the signed APK.
    *   Select the build variant (e.g., `release`).
    *   Click **Finish** (or **Create**).
    *   The signed APK will be generated in the specified destination folder (usually `app/release/app-release.apk`).

## Project Structure

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns across three main layers:

### Presentation Layer
*   **Activities**: Main UI screens including news feed, favourites, settings, and about pages
*   **ViewModels**: `presentation/` - State management and business logic coordination
*   **UI Components**: `components/` - Reusable Compose components for consistent UI

### Domain Layer
*   **Models**: `domain/model/` - Core business entities and data models
*   **Use Cases**: `domain/usecase/` - Single-responsibility business operations
*   **Repository Interfaces**: `domain/repository/` - Data access contracts

### Data Layer
*   **API Service**: `data/` - Retrofit service for Hacker News API integration
*   **Data Sources**: `data/datasource/` - Remote API and local database data sources
*   **Repository Implementations**: `data/repository/` - Concrete data access with caching
*   **Cache Management**: `data/cache/` - Intelligent caching with automatic expiration
*   **Database**: `database/` - Room database for offline storage and favourites

### Supporting Infrastructure
*   **Dependency Injection**: `di/` - Manual DI container and ViewModel factory
*   **UI Theming**: `ui/theme/` - Material Design 3 theme system
*   **Resources**: `app/src/main/res/` - App resources (drawables, strings, etc.)

### Key Architecture Features
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation between UI and business logic
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design with dependency inversion
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access with local caching
- **Use Case Pattern**: Single-responsibility business operations
- **Manual Dependency Injection**: Lightweight DI without external frameworks
- **Offline-First**: Local caching with automatic expiration
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI following Google's design guidelines
